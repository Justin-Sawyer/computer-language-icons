# Computer Language Icons

[Computer Language Icons](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/computer-language-icons/index.html)

This is the very first project I created in CodeInstitute's Full Stack Web Development Course, using GitHub, GitPod and Git.
It is just a simple web site, with link to web technology entries in Wikipedia, but it is designed to allow the creator to get used to and understand the Command Line Interface (CLI).
 
It's been a lot of fun, although understanding some of the terminal (CLI) commands was taxing!
Git will take some getting used to, but check your repo notes and the notes you took on the Mac.

Happy coding, J, and remember:

## It's the start of a new adventure!
