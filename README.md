# Computer Language Icons

[Computer Language Icons](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/computer-language-icons/index.html)

This is the very first project I created in GitHub/GitPod. 
It's been a lot of fun, although understanding some of the terminal (CLI) commands was taxing!
Git will take some getting used to, but check your repo notes and the notes you took on the Mac.

Happy coding, J, and remember:

## It's the start of a new adventure!
